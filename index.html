        <h2 class="section-title">1. Project Information</h2>

        <h3>Project Title</h3>
        <p class="placeholder">IT Department Career Advancement Project</p>

        <h3>Project Manager</h3>
        <p class="placeholder">David Dominguez</p>

        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p class="placeholder">My mission is to gain the skills and experience needed to transition into an IT role at my current workplace, beginning with a Junior Systems Administrator or IT Support position. My vision is to continue developing within the company and grow into a Systems Administrator role within the next three to five years. The goal of my project is to build the technical expertise, professional relationships, and internal visibility needed to make that move possible.
            I will do this by applying new skills in practical settings at work, and seeking mentorship from experienced IT professionals.</p>

        <h3>Closure Type</h3>
        <p class="placeholder">Premature Closure - Ended Early, core objectives met </p>

        <h3>Closing Summary</h3>
        <p class="placeholder">Overall, this project went well and I was able to accomplish the main things I planned to do. 
            I created a clear plan for my career goals, chose a certification to work toward, and kept track of my progress throughout the semester. 
            I also reached out to my manager to discuss my interest in moving into IT in the future, which helped me get guidance and clarity on my 
            next steps. Some things that went really well were creating the project plan, making a decision about certifications, and getting helpful feedback from my professor.
            The main challenges were managing my time, balancing this project with other coursework, and adjusting the project so it fit the semester timeline. </p>

        <!-- SECTION 4 ------------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2 class="section-title">4. Performance Analysis</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Budget Performance</h3>
        <p class="placeholder">This project did not require a budget, and I did not have any unexpected costs. Overall, budget was not an issue for this project.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Schedule Performance</h3>
        <p class="placeholder">I met some of my semester milestones, but not all of them. The biggest reason for delays was that my situation changed during the semester. I went from being unemployed to working full time while also taking classes full time, which made it harder to keep up with my original plan. I also changed my project scope in the middle of the semester, and that required me to adjust my timeline.
Some of my time estimates were realistic, but others were not. I underestimated how much time I would need for certain tasks, especially once my schedule got busier. Even though I did not meet every milestone on time, I was able to finish the most important parts of the project by adjusting my plan and focusing on what mattered most.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 5 ------------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2 class="section-title">5. Stakeholder Management</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">For this project, my stakeholders were my instructor, my manager, my peers in class, and my colleagues at work. I would check in with my instructor during the semester and got helpful feedback that kept me on track. I also talked with my manager about my career goals, which gave me guidance and support on what steps I should focus on. My peers provided support through feedback and ideas, and my colleagues at work shared their own experiences and advice, which helped me think about my goals more clearly.
            Overall, the communication with everyone was helpful and gave me different perspectives that supported my project.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 6 ------------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2 class="section-title">6. Risk and Issue Summary</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">One risk I faced during this project was falling behind because of my coursework and other responsibilities. I handled this by adjusting my timeline and focusing on the most important tasks first. Another issue was not always knowing the best next step, which I managed by asking my instructor and manager for guidance when needed.

I also had trouble keeping up with weekly tasks at times, so I simplified my goals to make them easier to finish. There were no major technical or operational risks, but one thing I still need to watch is staying consistent with my career-development work after the project ends. Keeping up with my certification and building my skills will continue to be important moving forward.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 7 ------------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2 class="section-title">7. What Went Well?</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">Several things went well during this project. I was able to stay organized and keep track of my progress each week, which helped me see what I had finished and what still needed work. Talking with my professor and manager gave me helpful guidance and made sure I was moving in the right direction. I also did well with researching certifications and understanding what steps I need to take for my career.
            Overall, staying consistent, asking for feedback, and keeping my work organized were the biggest strengths of this project.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 8 ------------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2 class="section-title">8. What Didn’t Go Well?</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">One of the biggest challenges I faced was staying consistent with my original project plan. I ended up changing the project scope in the middle of the semester because my situation changed. I went from being unemployed to working full time while also attending school full time. This made it harder for me to stay focused and keep up with my weekly goals. The transition took a lot of my time and energy, and it caused delays while I adjusted my plans. I also struggled with time management, and some tasks took longer than I expected.
            Overall, balancing a new full time job with school and switching project directions were the main difficulties I experienced.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 9 ------------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2 class="section-title">9. What Would You Do Differently?</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">If I were to do this again, I’d pick a different class project like building a MVP web app, which is something I’ve been wanting to try. I’d also plan my time better so I’m not rushing at the end.
            My recommendation is to reach out for help or feedback sooner instead of waiting until the end.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 11 ----------------------------------------------------------->
        <h2 class="section-title">11. Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">
            1. Start with a realistic scope. Keeping the project small and focused makes it easier to stay on track and avoid overwhelm
            2. Get feedback early. Asking my teacher or manager for input sooner makes the project go smoother and keeps me from going in the wrong direction.
            3. Stay organized each week. Using a tracker or checklist each week makes it easier to see what’s done and what still needs work.

            I also appreciate my classmates for their advice, encouragement, and support during the semester.
            I am especially grateful to my manager and colleagues at work.
            My manager not only listened to my career goals but also started giving me more computer-related tasks and even adjusted my schedule for next year so I can work and go to school during work hours.
            My colleagues also shared advice and helped me learn more on the job.
            Their support has made a big difference for me and has helped me feel more confident about my future career path.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">14. What's Next?</h2>
        <p class="placeholder">After this project, my next steps are to keep building my skills so I can move into a IT departemt job in healthcare. Since I talked with my manager about my career goals, she has been giving me more computer-related tasks at work, and I plan to keep learning from those opportunities because they can help me advance in my role. 
            I plan to continue studying for the certification I chose as well.
This project changed how I approach project management by teaching me to set realistic goals, manage my time carefully, and adjust when life changes. 
            It also showed me how valuable communication and asking for guidance can be.</p>
